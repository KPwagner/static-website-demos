# Static Website Example for AWS

You need to deploy a website to AWS infrastructure. You've heard something about S3 buckets and how they can do that. Then, you found it's a lot more complicated than you expected. If this sounds familiar, you are in the right place.

This project includes an example static website intended to be deployed to an AWS account. The project includes a demonstration for using a custom domain and an SSL certficate (issued by AWS), so your site can be HTTPS. The project includes the following:
1. An AWS CloudFormation template with all necesary resources.
2. A Github workflow with necesarry steps for deployment.
3. HTML files of a simple website.

The project includes an AWS CloudFormation example. Terraform and CDK will follow. If you plan to use Terraform or CDK for your websites infrasture as code (IaC), the example CloudFormation template may still help you.

## How to use this project

The purpose of this project is to provide a complete working example of an HTTPS website with a custom domain. It's not a `copy all + paste`. You will need to examine the code and pick what you need and of course troubleshoot deployment problems. While this project is not a total __easy button__, a complete project that uses IaC can save you a lot of time.
